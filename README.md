This is a fork of the QuickSmelt plugin on uMod.

Differences from uMod version:

- Smelting/cooking animations are actually accurate
- Smelting/cooking multiple items at once does not increase efficiency (like vanilla)
- Multipliers are baselined against vanilla
- Electric furnaces work
- Furnaces started via electricity or igniters will function the same as furnaces started directly by a player (uMod version will not detect this, causing furnaces to use vanilla rates in those cases)
- Increasing speed simply increases the amount that is smelted at once, so you can't achieve rates like 0.5x, 1.5x or 2.5x, but you can do 2x, 3x, etc.
